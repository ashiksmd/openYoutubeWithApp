##Open Youtube videos with external video player##

This chrome extension adds a context menu entry on youtube pages to allow them to be played using
an external video player. Currently, this uses SMPlayer, but this can be easily changed in the
openYoutubewithApp.py script.

To install follow the instructions in the README files in the respective folders of the host and the
extension.
